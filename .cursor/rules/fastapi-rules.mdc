- Always use python 3.13
- Use FastAPI for building APIs.
- Frameworks:
  - pydantic v2
  - fastapi
  - sqlalchemy
  - alembic
- Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations.
- Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.

Key Conventions

1. Rely on FastAPI's dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.
2. Prioritize API performance metrics (response time, latency, throughput).
3. Limit blocking operations in routes:   
   - Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.   
   - Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.   
   - Structure routes and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.   

Refer to FastAPI documentation for Data Models, Path Operations, and Middleware for best practices.

FastAPI-Specific Guidelines

- Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas.
- Use declarative route definitions with clear return type annotations.
- Minimize @app.on_event("startup") and @app.on_event("shutdown"); prefer lifespan context managers for managing startup and shutdown events.
- Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization.
- Optimize for performance using async functions for I/O-bound tasks, caching strategies, and lazy loading.
- Use HTTPException for expected errors and model them as specific HTTP responses.
- Use middleware for handling unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring.
- Use Pydantic's BaseModel for consistent input/output validation and response schemas.
